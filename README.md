calculation_tester is a simple Matlab UI to generate 2x2 multiplication problems and score them. 
Any key will generate a new problem initially. When an answer is given by the participant, hit any key to stop the timer. Hit any key again to show the answer, and then hit 'y' to score a correct answer, 'n' to score an incorrect answer, and 'x' to score a "time expired" answer. "x" will be scored by default if timer expires before the answer is given. 
Hit 'e' at any time to end session, display score, and write a .mat file with the session data.
